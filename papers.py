=== Module Description ===
This module contains a new class, PaperTree, which is used to model data on
publications in a particular area of Computer Science Education research.
This data is adapted from a dataset presented at SIGCSE 2019.
You can find the full dataset here: https://www.brettbecker.com/sigcse2019/

Although this data is very different from filesystem data, it is still
hierarchical. This means we are able to model it using a TMTree subclass,
and we can then run it through our treemap visualisation tool to get a nice
interactive graphical representation of this data.

TODO: (Task 6) Complete the steps below
Recommended steps:
1. Start by reviewing the provided dataset in cs1_papers.csv. You can assume
   that any data used to generate this tree has this format,
   i.e., a csv file with the same columns (same column names, same order).
   The categories are all in one column, separated by colons (':').
   However, you should not make assumptions about what the categories are, how
   many categories there are, the maximum number of categories a paper can have,
   or the number of lines in the file.

2. Read through all the docstrings in this file once. There is a lot to take in,
   so don't feel like you need to understand it all the first time.
   Draw some pictures!
   We have provided the headers of the initializer as well as of some helper
   functions we suggest you implement. Note that we will not test any
   private top-level functions, so you can choose not to implement these
   functions, and you can add others if you want to for your solution.
   For this task, we will be testing that you are building the correct tree,
   not that you are doing it in a particular way. We will access your class
   in the same way as in the client code in the visualizer.

3. Plan out what you'll need to do to implement the PaperTree initializer.
   In particular, think about how to use the boolean parameters to do different
   things in setting up the tree. You may also find it helpful to review the
   Python documentation about the csv module, which you are permitted and
   encouraged to use. You should have a good plan, including what your subtasks
   are, before you begin writing any code.

4. Write the code for the PaperTree initializer and any helper functions you
   want to use in your design. You should not make any changes to the public
   interface of this module, or of the PaperTree class, but you can add private
   attributes and helpers as needed.

5. Tidy and test your code, and try it with the visualizer client code. Make
   sure you have documented any new private attributes, and that PyTA passes
   on your code.
